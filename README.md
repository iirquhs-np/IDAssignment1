# M1LDL1FE Band Site

Access the site [here](https://github.shuqri.xyz/IDAssignment1/).

The site's audience is followers of the band who would want to know more about them. There is a history section in the
band sub-page where it talks about the band's formation and the members of the band.

The fans can gain from this by directly interacting with the band through the website. For example, they can buy 
merchandise from the site.

## Design Process

Provide us insights about your design process, focusing on whom this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process.
These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory)
Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url.

## Technologies Used

- Google Fonts - specifically [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat)
- [FormSubmit](https://formsubmit.co/)
    - This project uses **FormSubmit** to make HTML forms live.


## Testing
The site has been tested using the W3Schools validator with no major issues.
- https://validator.w3.org/
- https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/

Some testing process that you can go through:

1. Merchandise page:
   1. Go to the "Merch" page
   2. [to be filled up]


2. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that you will be redirected to a CAPTCHA page.
    5. After this you will see a “Thank You” page that lasts for 3 seconds, and then you will be redirected back to the contact page.
    

The project will also automatically shrink the page to an appropriate size when the browser size gets smaller.

A big thank you to my friends for helping me test the site and also by giving me suggestions on how I can improve it better.

I received inspiration from the original m1ldl1fe site.
